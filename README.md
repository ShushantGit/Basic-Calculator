This C++ program implements a basic calculator using object-oriented principles. It consists of two classes: input and calculator. The input class handles user input for two numbers, while the calculator class inherits from input and performs arithmetic operations based on the user's choice.

The program presents a menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exiting. After the user selects an operation, they input two numbers. The program then executes the chosen operation and displays the result. This process repeats until the user chooses to exit.

Error handling for division by zero is not explicitly implemented, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the user inputs zero as the second number for division. Additionally, the system("cls") function is used to clear the screen, which is platform-dependent and may not work on all systems.

Overall, while functional, the program could benefit from improved error handling and portability.
